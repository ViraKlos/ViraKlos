After coming to Poland in March 2022 from Ukraine I became Microsoft Certified in Power BI Data Analysis. Iâ€™m fluent in English and learning Polish. I have about 5 years of experience in Financial Reporting/Analysis at multinational companies in Ukraine and a CIMA Certificate in Business Accounting. All these along with my experience with Big Data while acquiring my masterâ€™s in economics (from one of the best economics schools in Eastern Europe) makes me a great candidate for a job as Junior Data Analyst

I'm finishing Business Intelligence bootcamp with Future Collars in Febuary. These are links to my projects within this course so far:
